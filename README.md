## Description:-

This is just a small project i build for my Portfolio.üòÅ

## Main Functionalities:-

<p>User can enter an alias(name) and then create a room where they can chat with others.</p>
<p>The room id could be copied with the users friends or contacts so that they can join the room as well.</p>
<p>NONE OF THE MESSAGES ARE STORED in any way.Although i use Mongodb,it is only for storing which all users are present in each room, so that i can retrieve the cached info( which includes a user's alias and the room they are currently in) from store.The users store info will also be deleted once the user exits the room or quits the application.</p>
